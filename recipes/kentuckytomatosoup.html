    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is great if you need to prepare a quick entree for your family when they come visit you!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>3 tablespoons butter</ul>
        <ul>1 cup chopped onion</ul>
        <ul>½ cup chopped carrots</ul>
        <ul>2 stalks celery, chopped</ul>
        <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
        <ul>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</ul>
        <ul>2 ½ cups chopped fresh tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</ul>
        <ul>¾ cup strong brewed coffee</ul>
        <ul>¼ cup water</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon white sugar</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>ground black pepper to taste</ul>
        <ul>⅓ cup heavy cream</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
